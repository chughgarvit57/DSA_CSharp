# 📘 ProblemSolvingDSACSharp  
A comprehensive collection of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) solutions implemented in C#.  

## 📂 Repository Structure  
This repository follows a structured branching model to maintain code organization and facilitate collaboration:  

- **`main` branch** → Serves as the primary documentation hub and contains only the `README.md` file.  
- **`dev` branch** → Acts as the working branch, containing all solution files and ongoing developments.  
- **Feature-specific branches** → Each data structure has its own dedicated branch under `dev`:  
  - **`arrays`** → Solutions for array-based problems.  
  - **`linked-lists`** → Implementations and challenges related to linked lists.  
  - **`strings`** → Solutions for string manipulation problems.  
  - **`stack`** → Stack implementation using linked lists.  
  - **`queue`** → Queue implementation using linked lists.
